		Linux driver quick porting recommendations


The whole point is to keep the diff between original Linux driver and ported
driver to minimum. This will help someone else to update the driver or driver
framework later.

1. Don't use "//" or "/* */" comments to disable code, instead prefer "#if 0"
2. Don't comment out header include lines if linux header does not exist,
   instead create place-holder linux compatible header
3. When changing function prototypes try to keep original function prototype
   using "#if 0"
